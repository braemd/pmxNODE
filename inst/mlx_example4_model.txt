DESCRIPTION:
A NODE for indirect response model. PK is modeled explicitly. Effect of drug concentration on kin is modeled with a NN.

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {V=2,kel=0.1,kin=40,ic50=3,R0=100}

PK:
; PK model definition
depot(target=C)

EQUATION:
R_0 = R0
kout = kin/R0
ddt_C = -kel * C
Cc = C/V
ddt_R = kin * (1 - NNr(state=C,min_init=0.5,max_init=5,time_nn=FALSE)) - kout * R

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc,R}
