\arguments{
\item{software}{(string) The software to be used for NN convertion; "Monolix","nlmixr", or "NONMEM"}

\item{mlx_path}{(string) Required if \emph{software="Monolix"}; path to Monolix location (under Windows usually 
C:/ProgramData/Lixoft/MonolixSuiteXXXX with XXXX as the version)}

\item{mlx_instal_path}{(string) Required if \emph{software="Monolix"} and lixoftConnectors package not yet installed. Path to the 
"lixoftConnectors.tar.gz" file, under Windows usually located at C:/ProgramData/Lixoft/MonolixSuiteXXXX/connectors/lixoftConnectors.tar.gz}

\value{
Initialization of software
}
\description{
Initialize the pharmacometric software you want to use (Monolix, nlmixr or NONMEM). Must be used before nn_converter functions
can be used for Monolix and nlmixr.
}
\details{
For NONMEM, no additional steps need to be done.\cr
For nlmixr, the nlmixr2 package is loaded. If nlmixr2 is not yet installed, it will install previous to loading. Note that automatic installation is only available for R versions 4.2 and higher. \cr
For Monolix, the lixoftConnectors package is loaded. For loading, the path to the Monolix location (under Windows usually 
C:/ProgramData/Lixoft/MonolixSuiteXXXX with XXXX as the version) is required. If lixoftConnectors is not yet installed, it
will install previous to loading, including its dependencies 'RJSONIO', 'ggplot2', and 'gridExtra'. \cr
Note: nlmixr2 and lixoftConnectors share function \emph{getData}. If both, nlmixr and Monolix, get initialized, \emph{getData}
will be used from the package initialized second
